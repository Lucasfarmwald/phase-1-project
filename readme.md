 "The International Space Station"

Welcome to  "The International Space Station".
In this project I am using fetch to grab information on the space station.
currently in this project I am displaying Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,Velocity and Visibility.
In this project I have also created a basic "Like" and "Dislike" button.
Both of these buttons display text into a text box after the button is "Clicked".
There is also box towards the bottom of the page that allows you to create a message of your own.
If you click the "submit" button it will display that text in the text box.

In this project I'm using "HTML,Javascript and CSS"
